# Nand2Tetris Part 1
This is my work done for part 1 of the Nand2Tetris course in which you build a computer from first principles. You start off building elementary logic gates and chips and end off building an assembler to translate assembly code into machine language. I have learnt a lot in this course and I would highly recommend it to others out there.
